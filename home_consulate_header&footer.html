              <details>
                  <summary>I am a Canadian citizen holding a Canadian passport. Do I need a tourist visa to go to Japan?</summary>
                  <p>No. A Canadian passport holder does not need a visa to enter Japan as a temporary visitor.</p>
              </details>
              <details>
                  <summary>My Canadian passport will expire within six months. Do I need to renew my passport? </summary>
                  <p>It is not necessary under Japanese immigration law. Your passport must be valid at the time of entry. Please note that airline company polices and restrictions may differ. It is best to confirm their policies directly with them. If you hold a Canadian travel document other than an ordinary passport, it must be valid for longer than six months.</p>

                  <p>It depends on your nationality or the passport you hold. If you hold a passport of a country with a reciprocal visa exemption arrangement with Japan, you do not need a visa to enter Japan as a tourist. Otherwise, you need one. More on Temporary Visitor's Visas.</p>

                  <summary>Can I enter Japan as a visitor without a visa, and then apply for a working visa, or another status of residence, while in Japan?</summary>
                  <p>No, a visa cannot be acquired after arriving in Japan. According to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, an application for the change of status from a temporary visitor to another status will only be accepted under special circumstances.
                      * A visa is a recommendation, made by an embassy or consulate, that a foreigner should be allowed to enter Japan. When an immigration officer completes an examination for landing and grants landing permission at the port of entry, a stamp is issued. This stamp is the legal documentation of the foreigner's status in Japan. The visa becomes irrelevant at this time (except for multiple-entry visas).</p>

                  <p>No. A re-entry permit is only issued by an immigration office in Japan. Before returning to Japan, you must re-apply for a visa.</p>

                  <p>According to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, Japanese citizens are required to use their Japanese passport to enter Japan. In some cases, such as with the JET Programme or a Japanese government scholarship program, the organization instructs you to enter Japan as a "foreigner” with your Canadian passport and to renounce your Japanese citizenship. Please inquire about the rules and regulations of the sponsor organization in Japan. <br>
      Moreover, you have to choose one citizenship before you turn 22 years old. In renouncing your Japanese citizenship, you will have to give up your Japanese passport. More information: The Choice of Nationality.</p>
